# breakout
## Billy McCune


This project implements the game of Breakout with multiple levels.

### Timeline

 * Start Date: 01/12/2024

 * Finish Date: 01/20/2024

 * Hours Spent: 30

### Running the Program

 * Main class: breakout/Main
      
 * Data files needed: The files in the levels folder.

 * Key/Mouse inputs:  

Right, Left, L, R, Digits 1-9, H, D, S

 * Cheat keys:
D - increase Ball damage by one
S - restarts game as if it's the first time loading
L - gives the player an extra life
R - resets the ball and paddle
1 - 9 - sends the player to the level number or the highest one available 


### Notes/Assumptions

 * Assumptions or Simplifications:
- biggest assumption is that the extra ball power-up only lets one ball appear
- if another extra ball power-up is hit then it will not make another one

 * Known Bugs:
- sometimes the ball can hit several blocks without bouncing
- balls don't side hit they only act like they hit the top and bottom

 * Features implemented:
 Break-01 Through 19 (except two see below)
 Cheat Key L
 Cheat Key D

 * Features unimplemented:
 * Break-18C - PowerUp-Lasers
 * Break-18A PowerUps-Paddle extension


 * Noteworthy Features:
   N/A 


### Assignment Impressions

The assignment was very time intensive for me.
I think the biggest issue was debugging and learning to implement new features.
I learned a lot about programming, and I'm excited for the next project where I'll hopefully be in 
better health.
